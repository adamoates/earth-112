# Session and Cache Configuration Fix

## Issue
The local database was continuously checking for sessions and cache of non-logged-in users because both session and cache drivers were set to 'database' but the database connection was failing.

## Solution
Changed both session and cache drivers from 'database' to 'file' in the .env file:

```env
SESSION_DRIVER=file
CACHE_STORE=file
```

## What This Fixes
- **No more database queries** for non-logged-in users
- **No more cache database queries** for anonymous visitors
- **Faster performance** for anonymous visitors
- **Sessions stored locally** in `storage/framework/sessions/`
- **Cache stored locally** in `storage/framework/cache/data/`
- **No database dependency** for session and cache management

## Benefits
- ✅ **Reduced database load**
- ✅ **Faster page loads** for anonymous users
- ✅ **No connection errors** when database is unavailable
- ✅ **Simpler development setup**
- ✅ **No cache database queries**

## Storage Locations
- **Sessions**: `storage/framework/sessions/`
- **Cache**: `storage/framework/cache/data/`

## For Production
If you want to use database sessions/cache in production (for better scalability), ensure:
1. Database connection is stable
2. Sessions table is migrated
3. Cache table is migrated
4. Proper database credentials are configured

## Alternative Drivers

### Session Drivers
- `file` - Sessions stored as files (current setup)
- `database` - Sessions stored in database (requires stable DB)
- `redis` - Sessions stored in Redis (high performance)
- `cookie` - Sessions stored in cookies (limited size)

### Cache Drivers
- `file` - Cache stored as files (current setup)
- `database` - Cache stored in database (requires stable DB)
- `redis` - Cache stored in Redis (high performance)
- `memcached` - Cache stored in Memcached
- `array` - Cache stored in memory (for testing)
